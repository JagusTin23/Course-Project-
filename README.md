### Instruction to viewing the SamsungMeanData.txt data

The read.table function should be used to view the SamsunMeanData.txt file. Please include header = TRUE argument. Otherwise the data will not be displayed correctly. 

The script run_analysis.R includes comments with a detailed description of each step taken to create the data set. The last two lines of the script will read the SamsungMeanData.txt file and will output the first six lines of the data set to the R console.
